			<p class="lead">Did you know that your favorite pizza topping
			can help determine what your next job will be? Job searching in the
			21st century can be stressful and time consuming. In many ways,
			looking for a job can be a job itself. One of the main hitches in the
			modern job search process is online job search engines that ask you a
			million questions and still give you a list of jobs that have no
			relevance to the kind of job you're looking for or who you are as a
			candidate. TinTech is a web app that gives tech job seekers a quick,
			fun way of finding jobs that are relevant to them. 
			TinTech helps tech job seekers save time on the job search by
			matching them with jobs based on both hard and soft skills. Tell us
			your favorite pizza topping, find your dream tech job, and work your
			best life!</p>
